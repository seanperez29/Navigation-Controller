    //Navigation Controllers are very useful for many apps. For example, a recipe app the you click on the meal that you want to bring up details, and then you lick on a link to a website that pushes on a webview. You can even use navigation controllers later on in your app and can load them programiatically and not just on the storyboard.

        navigationController?.popToRootViewControllerAnimated(true)
    }
